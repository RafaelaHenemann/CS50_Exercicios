                <li>This class is about more than computer programming!</li>
                <li>Indeed, this class is about problem-solving in a way that is exceedingly empowering! You will likely take the problem solving that you learn here will likely be instantly applicable to your work beyond this course and even your career as a whole!</li>
                <li>However, it will not be easy! You will be “drinking from the firehose” of knowledge during this course. You’ll be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish in the coming weeks.</li>
                <li>This course is far more about you advancing “you” from “where you are today” than hitting some imagined standard.</li>
                <li>The most important opening consideration in this course: Give the time you need to learn through this course. Everyone learns differently. If something does not work out well at the start, know that with time you will grow and grow in your skill.</li>
                <li>Don’t be scared if this is your first computer science class! For most of your peers, this is their first computer science class too!</li>
